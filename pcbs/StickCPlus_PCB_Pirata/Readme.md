# Parts needed to mount the board
To mount this PCB you will need:
* 1x [CC1101](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006427924521.html) (the frequency that matches your needs) 
* 1x [NRF24L01](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007279570381.html)
* 2x [SMD 4 Way DIP switch](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006144087226.html)
* 1x [BC547 transistor](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006810867671.html)
* 1x [TF Card socket](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007635265251.html)
* 6x [10k 0805 SMD resistor](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32847143167.html) (4 to the SD circuit and 2 in parallel for the Transistor polarization)
* 1x [TSOP38238 Infra red Receiver](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006814318117.html)
* 90 degree bent pinheader with 8 pins ([link](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006111330230.html))
* [Grove cable to connect into the Stick](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32818751577.html), you will need to cut and solder it to the board
* Optional: Grove connectors to connect other modules 

Obs: When soldering the components, be careful to add only the necessary amount of tin. 
Obs: The Resistor beside the Transistor, if you have 10k resistor, add 2 at the same spot (two in parallel to make a 5k resistor equivalent)
